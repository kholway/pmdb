# pmdb: Personal Movie Database
A simple database and api for tracking movies you want to watch as a group, say, for a family movie night!

Truly, a project for me to practice setting up a CRUD API, and beyond.

## Development 
### Tech Stack
The project uses FastAPI to handle the front end and SQLAlchemy to interface with the back end. The project currently uses an SQLite database.

### Approach
I'm attempting a test-driven development, where possible.

### Organization
- [`app.database`](app/database.py) handles database connections
